        Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan and one of the most remarkable leaders in history. 
        Born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, he devoted his life to securing the rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. 
        Through his tireless efforts, vision, and leadership, Pakistan emerged as an independent state on August 14, 1947. 
        Jinnah is remembered for his determination, eloquence, and integrity. He envisioned Pakistan as a democratic, inclusive, 
        and prosperous nation. His famous words, "Unity, Faith, and Discipline," continue to inspire generations.
